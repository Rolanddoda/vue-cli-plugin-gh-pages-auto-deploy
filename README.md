# :electric_plug: vue-cli-plugin-gh-pages-auto-deploy

-------

## :rocket: Getting Started

If yon don't have a project created with Vue CLI:

```sh
vue create vue-your-plugin
```

Install the plugin into your project:

```sh
cd vue-your-plugin
vue add gh-pages-auto-deploy
```

## What this plugin does ?

This plugin automates [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)
deployment by using [Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions).

## How ?
On every push or merge to the `master` branch, your code will be built and pushed
to a branch named `gh-pages`.
So, practically your code will automatically be deployed every time you push on `master`.

## How to make it work ?
- After you have added the plugin, just commit and push to `master`.

- Navigate to your github project and click 'Settings'
